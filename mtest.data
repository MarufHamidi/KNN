BAHIA COCOA REVIEW

SALVADOR, Feb 26 -

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone,
alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects
for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been
restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.  The dry period
means the temporao will be late this year.  Arrivals for the week
ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative
total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last
year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was
included in the arrivals figures.  Comissaria Smith said there is
still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as
harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop
estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln
there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.  There are doubts as to how much
of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing
dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.  In view of
the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of
their cocoa held on consignment.  Comissaria Smith said spot bean
prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.  Bean
shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited
sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne
to ports to be named.  New crop sales were also light and all to open
ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45
dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per
tonne FOB.  Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.  April/May butter went at 2.27 times New
York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to
4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at
4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and
open ports.  Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New
York Dec for Oct/Dec.  Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and
convertible currency areas.  Liquor sales were limited with
March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs
and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25
times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria
Smith said.  Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln
bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.  Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be
published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which
ends midday on February 27.  Reuter

CANADA STOCKS/DOME PETROLEUM LTD &lt;DMP&gt;

TORONTO, April 13 -

Dome Petroleum Ltd shares moved higher in the U.S. and Canada after
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP&gt; made a 4.3 billion Canadian dlr bid
for Dome and Dome said it is in talks with two other unidentified
companies.  Market speculation is that the other two potential bidders
are not Canadian companies and DuPont's &lt;DD&gt; Conoco and Atlantic
Richfield Co &lt;ARC&gt; are mentioned as possibilities, Wilf Gobert of
Peters and Co Ltd said.  Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock
Exchange. TransCanada PipeLines was down 1/4 at 15-3/4 on the New York
Stock Exchange.  Dome was the most active stock on the Toronto
exchange at 1.50 dlrs per share, up 37 cts.  Gobert characterized the
market action in Dome as "awfully optimistic" but said investors are
hoping for a competing offer to the shareholders.  TransCanada
PipeLines' offer is to Dome management, not to shareholders. However,
it proposes issuing new equity in a subsidiary that would operate Dome
assets. Current Dome shareholders would own 20 pct of the new
subsidiary.  Reuter
